We have been constructing a ‘map’ of the ‘hot spots’ of research methods around the world as part of a collaborative project supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as part of the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). This map had two aspects: first, to locate the innovations in method currently being developed within social science disciplines; and second, to locate the sites and institutional contexts of these innovations, that is, who and where they are being developed.</p> <p>The overall focus on innovative methodologies is inspired by the growing interest in identifying who and what acts as the ‘impetus’ for innovation in Social Science Research Methods. For the purposes of the project, innovative research practices in the social sciences initially referred to research practices which haven’t yet filtered through to typical research methods courses or which impact on the research process in ways which are novel or different to existing ones. In the course of the project though, an emerging definition was formed as driven by the data. This defined methodological developments and innovations in three broad ways: driven by advances in technology; driven by interdisciplinarity; and owing to intra-disciplinary or intra-methodological developments and extensions. This emerging definition is in line with recent literature on emergent methods.</p> <p>For the purposes of the project, the focus on innovative research practices included research design, data collection and analysis and covered disciplines such as (social) psychology, sociology, social work, socio-legal studies, political science (including public health and public policy) and international studies, (social) geography (area studies, demography, environmental and urban planning), (social) anthropology, (socio-)linguistics, education, communication studies, economic and social history, economics (management and business studies), science and technology studies, statistics, methods and computing. The presentation focuses on the methodology employed for the project, the innovative methodologies identified and conclusions in the form of reflections.</p>","[title], [a_name], [catsid], [times]","[title] [dates]","0","0","0000-00-00",,"0","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0","0","1"

It is the problem how to take norms, or social structure, seriously whilst allowing for agent autonomy. The current agent-orientated solution is often rational choice theory. The methodology of agent-based simulation is a possibility to approach the paradox differently.  </p> <ul>   <li>Simulation can take emergence seriously, no longer making it something like a ‘black box’ carried through theory. </li>   <li>Simulation can take structure seriously at the same time as autonomy as feedback between structure and agency can be modelled (EMIL).</li>   <li>Simulation can implement kinds of reasoning other than rationality to inform choice and guide behaviour.</li> </ul> <p>In criminology the structure-agency dichotomy is particularly strong and has important policy origins and consequences. Theories of crime strongly shape the criminal justice system at the same time as political ideology shapes prevalence of certain theories of crime. Currently crime simulations are either very strongly structural, simulating towns with opportunities for crime etc. or they are rational choice based. </p> <p>I argue that the analysis of crime needs another kind of reasoning, as cost/benefit analysis does not suffice to explain most crime phenomena. I call this ‘other kind’ moral reasoning. In the talk I will discuss possibilities for what moral reasoning might be in this context and how it can be formalised and implemented in simulation. </p>","[title], [a_name], [catsid], [times]","[title] [dates]","0","0","0000-00-00",,"0","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0","0","1"

Such a concept has been related to work performance in organisations, but it raises questions when we attempt to model it. Working from social network analysts Cross and Parker’s identification of who energises or de-energises whom in organisations, social psychologists Ryan and Deci’s work on intrinsic motivation, and sociologist Randall Collins’s theory of interaction ritual chains, we developed a family of agent-based simulation models, in which agents gain emotional energy and cultural capital during interaction rituals.</p>    <p class=""MsoNormal""> We use simulation models as tools for thinking about what energy is, and how it relates to the take up of ideas, the formation of cultural groups and the performance of work. Our models also provide insight into phenomena from studies of “communities of practice” and group solidarity. All our models reveal interdependencies between interaction rates, group sizes and cultural diversity.</p>      <p class=""MsoNormal"">&nbsp;</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><strong>Dr Christopher Watts</strong> is Research Fellow in the Centre for Research in Social Simulation (CRESS), University of Surrey, where he works with Nigel Gilbert on the ESRC-funded SIMIAN project.

By “trust” here, I mean that we can trust strangers which we do not have information about. In Japanese society, they often think that it is important to take care of and hold on connections between themselves and particular people. Because they think that if they use such connections positively, they can get special treatment and maximize self-interest. At the same time, in the American society, they do not hang on to such connections as much as in Japanese society. For example, when Japanese look for jobs, they are likely to depend on their or their familiar person’s particular connection to the employer. But when Americans are in the same circumstances, they would try to get recruiting ad and call for employer’s office, or they may try to use connections, but these are not strong ones, such as ones of a friend of a friend of a friend. This is introduced in “Strength of Weak Ties” written by Granovetter, M. For the record, the above about Japan is a little old story. After rapid and widespread diffusion of the Internet in Japan, the Japanese use recruiting ads positively. Nevertheless, many Japanese would think it is very important to use connections currently.<br />According to the paper [3], Japanese society is structured with “security”, not with “trust”. We can distinguish “security” and “trust” by extent of social uncertainty influence. Please refer to the Appendix for “social uncertainty”. If social uncertainty influence is strong in a society, it is defined as a “trust” society. And if social uncertainty influence is weak in a society, it is defined as a “security” society.<br />Why did Japanese society become a security society? Why did American one do a trust one? Why did such a difference arise between Japan and U.S? We can guess this problem is structured with many elements, such as geographical, religious, historical, cultural one and so on. But if we consider these all elements, it would be too difficult for us to analyze the problem and explain the reason. So I will regard the problem as simpler one, compose artificial societies on computers, analyze these, and bring out reasons for above questions. </p><p><strong>APPENDIX</strong><br />Social uncertainty [4]<br />Social uncertainty is ubiquitous in human society. Whenever we interact with others we face the problem of social uncertainty. We engage in social interactions with others to improve our own welfare, material or psycho-logical; however, in interacting with others we make ourselves vulnerable. We seek to improve our welfare while taking the risk of incurring costs. We use the term “social uncertainty” to refer to the risk of being exploited in social interactions. That is, social uncertainty is defined as existing for an actor when (1) his or her interaction partner has an incentive to act in a way that imposes costs (or harm) on the actor and (2) the actor does not have enough information to predict if the partner will in fact act in such a way.</p><p><strong> References</strong><br />1.

Collective credit in question is subject to an adaptation<br />of the Grameen Bank lending methodology in Mexico. An analysis has<br />been made on the close interplay between institutional norms, i.e.<br />repayment conditions imposed by the microfinance institution (MFI),<br />and emergent cooperation or penalisation strategies that are entirely<br />handled by clients to meet targets for managing debts and defaulters.<br /><br />In this case, a sociological and financial fieldwork has been<br />completed through surveying 600 MFI clients, their 2404 loans, 35<br />credit officers plus the MFI board of directors. This took place in<br />the southernmost state of Chiapas, from September 2007 to February<br />2008, and data analysis was carried out during that period until July<br />2009. All findings obtained in this process were discussed with<br />relevant policy makers and this proved key in providing influential<br />insights that helped improving the regulatory framework of the MFI.<br />Results from data analysis include the following:<br /><br />(1) insights backed by up-to-date data that helped to adapt existing<br />MFI credit policies by taking into consideration the predominant<br />social norms in successful microcredit groups;<br /><br />(2) analysed evidence was deemed as reliable by the stakeholders, and<br />that guided the development of a descriptive model for simulating how<br />microcredit groups deal with repayments in adversity.<br /><br />Individual agent decisions and memory properties in the simulation<br />model are represented descriptively using a matrix data structure,<br />which contain vectors chronologically organised with outcomes of<br />endorsed events between members.

Industrial Districts are geographical clusters mainly based on small and medium sized firms, in which cooperation and competition take place at the same time and high level of specialization and flexibility are reached. Another important element characterizing Industrial Districts is the strong interplay between the economic/productive system and the social system: the underlying social structure of Industrial Districts and the economic/productive system co-evolve and are influenced from each other.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""mso-ansi-language: EN-GB;"">Industrial Districts are particularly diffused in Italy, but they also characterize the organization of some productive areas in United States (e.g. Silicon Valley), Brazil, France and Japan (though in different forms). </span></p>

Both are small, simple and stylized representations. The first deals with questions of vicarious learning, transactive memory and trust in system of two agents (at a later date an N agent model will be tested). Trust is modeled as the belief that another person's advice can be relied on and this belief is seen as no different from other beliefs about the state of the real world. The second model builds on a prequel (Rodan ,2008), a model of network learning. Its focus is on 'defensive' learning heuristics in an environment in which some agents, not readily identifiable, employ 'tertius strategies' (Burt 1999, 2000) that makes it  problematic to rely on the information they  provide.</p>","[title], [a_name], [catsid], [times]","[title] [dates]","0","0","0000-00-00",,"0","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0","0","1"

<p>Dr Christopher Watts<br /><br />We discuss the use of simulation models as tools for rethinking innovation in a way more compatible with Science and Technology Studies (STS) than that encoded in standard models of the diffusion of innovation. In the standard conception of innovation, often dubbed the ""linear model"", innovation processes are divided into phases, including an origin and a diffusion phase. Key components in this conception include word-of-mouth epidemic models with their characteristic S-curve shaped growth data. However, studies in the literature of sociology of translation, or Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and the social construction of technology (SCOT) have drawn attention to how there is a complexity among the determinants of the success of a particular technology, product or project. To incorporate this very different conception of innovation diffusion we employ computer simulations, but rather different ones to those traditionally used. Innovation is represented less as a disease epidemic and more as multiple problems in constraint satisfaction, tackled in parallel in socio-technical networks. Mathematical analyses, curve fitting and forecasts are seen to be of little use. Qualitative data and qualitative model outcomes become more important, as we seek to communicate better an understanding of innovation. Issues raised under this revised understanding include ownership of innovation and the rewards for an identified ""innovator"", the degree to which would-be users / adopters should be constrained in their manipulation and reinterpretation of an innovation, and the extent to which organisations can plan for innovation. Our models, used as tools for rethinking innovation, bring together work on complex adaptive systems and that of STS. We invite further discussion on how best qualitative studies can be combined with simulation modelling.</p>","[title], [a_name], [catsid], [times]","[title] [dates]","0","0","0000-00-00",,"0","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0","0","1"
