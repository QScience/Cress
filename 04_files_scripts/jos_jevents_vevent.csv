<p><span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Cochin; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"">Environmental policy in general and sustainability policies in particular depend on communicating future impacts of current trends. One influential approach to achieve this has relied on scenario analysis to envision and enact a shared sustainable future. The approach is well known in transition management where it supported the ecological modernisation of various infrastructures. What signifies this type of modelling is the normative dimension made explicit in envisioning a shared target. Public participation has been considered crucial even in cases of private sector modernisation. This position is also taken by some agent-based modellers even though not all participatory ABMs subscribe to it. Most researchers are interested in working with stakeholders to develop good models. This concerns first of all the acquisition of reliable data but extends across all stages of agent-based modelling. In the environmental domain it often goes together with the aim of motivating stakeholders to change harmful behaviours. In this respect participation is expected to facilitate consensus building and social learning bearing similarities to participation in scenario analysis. However, depending on the complexity of society this can be a challenging task. Participation has to be aligned according to the type of simulation and the social context surrounding the model in order to produce legitimate results.</span></p>"";s:12:""publish_down"";s:10:""2011-01-25"";s:10:""publish_up"";s:10:""2011-01-25"";s:7:""SUMMARY"";s:79:""Frank Schiller: Modelling with Participants - Embedding socio-ecological models"";s:7:""DTSTART"";i:1295958600;s:5:""DTEND"";i:1295964000;s:5:""RRULE"";a:4:{s:4:""FREQ"";s:4:""none"";s:5:""COUNT"";i:1;s:8:""INTERVAL"";s:1:""1"";s:5:""BYDAY"";s:24:""+1TU,+2TU,+3TU,+4TU,+5TU"";}s:8:""MULTIDAY"";s:1:""1"";s:9:""NOENDTIME"";s:1:""0"";s:7:""X-COLOR"";s:0:"""";}",,"1","1","0"

In the first study, we explore the implications of a self-fulfilling prophecy-based explanation for persistent stigmatisation (i.e., negative attitudes over time), using the De-stigmatisation Simulation (DSIM) model. Within this context, the interactions between a stigmatised minority group and a non-stigmatised majority group are simulated, with the aim of better understanding the psychological mechanisms that underlie the process of becoming less stigmatised.  Results from a series of simulations are consistent with Allport's (1954) 'contact hypothesis'. According to the original theory stigma reduction would only occur when several 'optimal conditions' were met, these being equal status, cooperation, common goals and  the support of authorities recognised by both groups. Further evidence collected over the last five decades shows that the optimal conditions reinforce the effects of contact as opposed to providing preconditions (see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006).  DSIM replicates these findings, but also uniquely shows the difference between factors impacts on how much stigmatisation can be reduced (equal status and authority sanctions) and also how quickly this happens (cooperation and common goals). </span></span></p>

Findings show that in most cases, new members are drawn from agents that were socially connected to the original group members, preventing the group from performing any large scale expansions. </span></span></p>

In the standard conception of innovation, often dubbed the ""linear model"", innovation processes are divided into phases, including an origin and a diffusion phase. Key components in this conception include word-of-mouth epidemic models with their characteristic S-curve shaped growth data. However, studies in the literature of sociology of translation, or Actor-Network Theory (ANT), and the social construction of technology (SCOT) have drawn attention to how there is a complexity among the determinants of the success of a particular technology, product or project. To incorporate this very different conception of innovation diffusion we employ computer simulations, but rather different ones to those traditionally used. Innovation is represented less as a disease epidemic and more as multiple problems in constraint satisfaction, tackled in parallel in socio-technical networks. Mathematical analyses, curve fitting and forecasts are seen to be of little use. Qualitative data and qualitative model outcomes become more important, as we seek to communicate better an understanding of innovation. Issues raised under this revised understanding include ownership of innovation and the rewards for an identified ""innovator"", the degree to which would-be users / adopters should be constrained in their manipulation and reinterpretation of an innovation, and the extent to which organisations can plan for innovation. Our models, used as tools for rethinking innovation, bring together work on complex adaptive systems and that of STS. We invite further discussion on how best qualitative studies can be combined with simulation modelling.</p>"";s:12:""publish_down"";s:10:""2010-11-02"";s:10:""publish_up"";s:10:""2010-11-02"";s:7:""SUMMARY"";s:111:""Christopher Watts: Adopting and Adapting: When diffusion-of-innovation models meet the sociology of translation"";s:7:""DTSTART"";i:1288701000;s:5:""DTEND"";i:1288706400;s:5:""RRULE"";a:4:{s:4:""FREQ"";s:4:""none"";s:5:""COUNT"";i:1;s:8:""INTERVAL"";s:1:""1"";s:5:""BYDAY"";s:24:""+1TU,+2TU,+3TU,+4TU,+5TU"";}s:8:""MULTIDAY"";s:1:""1"";s:9:""NOENDTIME"";s:1:""0"";s:7:""X-COLOR"";s:0:"""";}",,"4","1","0"

<p>This research considers the role of conventional social behaviour<br />amongst microfinance clients in terms of influencing groups' success<br />or failure. Collective credit in question is subject to an adaptation<br />of the Grameen Bank lending methodology in Mexico. An analysis has<br />been made on the close interplay between institutional norms, i.e.<br />repayment conditions imposed by the microfinance institution (MFI),<br />and emergent cooperation or penalisation strategies that are entirely<br />handled by clients to meet targets for managing debts and defaulters.<br /><br />In this case, a sociological and financial fieldwork has been<br />completed through surveying 600 MFI clients, their 2404 loans, 35<br />credit officers plus the MFI board of directors. This took place in<br />the southernmost state of Chiapas, from September 2007 to February<br />2008, and data analysis was carried out during that period until July<br />2009. All findings obtained in this process were discussed with<br />relevant policy makers and this proved key in providing influential<br />insights that helped improving the regulatory framework of the MFI.<br />Results from data analysis include the following:<br /><br />(1) insights backed by up-to-date data that helped to adapt existing<br />MFI credit policies by taking into consideration the predominant<br />social norms in successful microcredit groups;<br /><br />(2) analysed evidence was deemed as reliable by the stakeholders, and<br />that guided the development of a descriptive model for simulating how<br />microcredit groups deal with repayments in adversity.<br /><br />Individual agent decisions and memory properties in the simulation<br />model are represented descriptively using a matrix data structure,<br />which contain vectors chronologically organised with outcomes of<br />endorsed events between members. A reactive model has also been<br />developed to highlight issues such as sensitivity to initial<br />conditions and how such such path-dependency can a priori influence<br />this version of the simulation that updates agent numerical properties<br />linearly.</p>"";s:12:""publish_down"";s:10:""2010-03-02"";s:10:""publish_up"";s:10:""2010-03-02"";s:7:""SUMMARY"";s:91:""Conventional social behaviour amongst microfinance clients - Pablo Lucas (CfPM, Manchester)"";s:11:""X-CREATEDBY"";i:62;s:7:""DTSTART"";i:1267533000;s:5:""DTEND"";i:1267538400;s:5:""RRULE"";a:4:{s:4:""FREQ"";s:4:""none"";s:5:""COUNT"";i:1;s:8:""INTERVAL"";s:1:""1"";s:5:""BYDAY"";s:2:""TU"";}s:8:""MULTIDAY"";s:1:""1"";s:9:""NOENDTIME"";s:1:""0"";s:7:""X-COLOR"";s:0:"""";}",,"12","1","0"

<p>We aim to assess the construct validity of agent-based simulations of normative behaviour with respect to social psychology. Although individual psychology is of great importance for the explanation of normative behaviour, social psychology is more appropriate as a theoretical backdrop of agent-based modelling.  Whilst individual psychology focuses on norm internalisation, social psychology focuses on the behavioural aspects and behavioural consequences of norms in a social setting, as do most agent-based simulations. We will take up this focus and see what agent-based simulation can contribute to the field of normative behaviour. In so doing, we aim to assess the extent to which current simulations are theoretically embedded and to discuss the potential contribution of social psychological theories in this theoretical embedding.</p>
<p>This is very much work in progress rather than a finished product. We will give a short introduction to relevant theories in social psychology followed by a discussion of two famous simulations of social norms, Axelrod (1986) and Epstein (1999). We will give an outline of the social psychology theories that are related to those models. We then discuss briefly one of the most recent normative behaviour simulations resulting from the ‘EMIL: Emergence in the Loop’ project. We finish with the most important part of this talk: YOUR FEEDBACK.</p>

<p>There have recently been several attempts to link social interactions to some sort of concept of motivation or group solidarity, often under the term “energy”. Such a concept has been related to work performance in organisations, but it raises questions when we attempt to model it. Working from social network analysts Cross and Parker’s identification of who energises or de-energises whom in organisations, social psychologists Ryan and Deci’s work on intrinsic motivation, and sociologist Randall Collins’s theory of interaction ritual chains, we developed a family of agent-based simulation models, in which agents gain emotional energy and cultural capital during interaction rituals.</p>
<p>We use simulation models as tools for thinking about what energy is, and how it relates to the take up of ideas, the formation of cultural groups and the performance of work. Our models also provide insight into phenomena from studies of “communities of practice” and group solidarity. All our models reveal interdependencies between interaction rates, group sizes and cultural diversity.</p>

<p>According to studies of the Japan-U.S. comparison about trust and cooperation [1] [2], the Japanese seems not to trust another person than an American. By “trust” here, I mean that we can trust strangers which we do not have information about. In Japanese society, they often think that it is important to take care of and hold on connections between themselves and particular people. Because they think that if they use such connections positively, they can get special treatment and maximize self-interest. At the same time, in the American society, they do not hang on to such connections as much as in Japanese society. For example, when Japanese look for jobs, they are likely to depend on their or their familiar person’s particular connection to the employer. But when Americans are in the same circumstances, they would try to get recruiting ad and call for employer’s office, or they may try to use connections, but these are not strong ones, such as ones of a friend of a friend of a friend. This is introduced in “Strength of Weak Ties” written by Granovetter, M. For the record, the above about Japan is a little old story. After rapid and widespread diffusion of the Internet in Japan, the Japanese use recruiting ads positively. Nevertheless, many Japanese would think it is very important to use connections currently.</p>
<p>According to the paper [3], Japanese society is structured with “security”, not with “trust”. We can distinguish “security” and “trust” by extent of social uncertainty influence. Please refer to the Appendix for “social uncertainty”. If social uncertainty influence is strong in a society, it is defined as a “trust” society. And if social uncertainty influence is weak in a society, it is defined as a “security” society.</p>
<p>Why did Japanese society become a security society? Why did American one do a trust one? Why did such a difference arise between Japan and U.S? We can guess this problem is structured with many elements, such as geographical, religious, historical, cultural one and so on. But if we consider these all elements, it would be too difficult for us to analyze the problem and explain the reason. So I will regard the problem as simpler one, compose artificial societies on computers, analyze these, and bring out reasons for above questions.</p>
<p>APPENDIX</p>
<p>Social uncertainty [4]</p>
<p>Social uncertainty is ubiquitous in human society. Whenever we interact with others we face the problem of social uncertainty. We engage in social interactions with others to improve our own welfare, material or psycho-logical; however, in interacting with others we make ourselves vulnerable. We seek to improve our welfare while taking the risk of incurring costs. We use the term “social uncertainty” to refer to the risk of being exploited in social interactions. That is, social uncertainty is defined as existing for an actor when (1) his or her interaction partner has an incentive to act in a way that imposes costs (or harm) on the actor and (2) the actor does not have enough information to predict if the partner will in fact act in such a way.</p>

<p>It is about fifteen years* since social scientists first started talking about ‘agent-based models’. In this talk, I’ll take a look at what has been achieved during those years, try to summarise what I see as the current ‘state of the art’, and list some challenges for the future. Most of the talk will be based on personal reminiscences (it is the last seminar of the academic year!), but I’ll also consult some presentations I gave in the late 1990s, co-citation analyses of JASSS and CMOT, and abstracts of recently funded European research projects. I shall conclude that agent-based simulation has so far avoided becoming a ‘normal’ science (Kuhn 1970) but may not do so for much longer.</p>
<p>* the earliest reference to multi-agent model I can find is 1994.</p>

<p>We have been constructing a ‘map’ of the ‘hot spots’ of research methods around the world as part of a collaborative project supported by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as part of the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). This map had two aspects: first, to locate the innovations in method currently being developed within social science disciplines; and second, to locate the sites and institutional contexts of these innovations, that is, who and where they are being developed.</p>
<p>The overall focus on innovative methodologies is inspired by the growing interest in identifying who and what acts as the ‘impetus’ for innovation in Social Science Research Methods. For the purposes of the project, innovative research practices in the social sciences initially referred to research practices which haven’t yet filtered through to typical research methods courses or which impact on the research process in ways which are novel or different to existing ones. In the course of the project though, an emerging definition was formed as driven by the data. This defined methodological developments and innovations in three broad ways: driven by advances in technology; driven by interdisciplinarity; and owing to intra-disciplinary or intra-methodological developments and extensions. This emerging definition is in line with recent literature on emergent methods.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the project, the focus on innovative research practices included research design, data collection and analysis and covered disciplines such as (social) psychology, sociology, social work, socio-legal studies, political science (including public health and public policy) and international studies, (social) geography (area studies, demography, environmental and urban planning), (social) anthropology, (socio-)linguistics, education, communication studies, economic and social history, economics (management and business studies), science and technology studies, statistics, methods and computing. The presentation focuses on the methodology employed for the project, the innovative methodologies identified and conclusions in the form of reflections.</p>

<p>Speaker : Corinna Elsenbroich (CRESS)</p>
<p>When it comes to norms in the social sciences, the problem can be called the Paradox of Agency. It is the problem how to take norms, or social structure, seriously whilst allowing for agent autonomy. The current agent-orientated solution is often rational choice theory. The methodology of agent-based simulation is a possibility to approach the paradox differently.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulation can take emergence seriously, no longer making it something like a ‘black box’ carried through theory. </li>
<li>Simulation can take structure seriously at the same time as autonomy as feedback between structure and agency can be modelled (EMIL).</li>
<li>Simulation can implement kinds of reasoning other than rationality to inform choice and guide behaviour.</li>
</ul>
<p>In criminology the structure-agency dichotomy is particularly strong and has important policy origins and consequences. Theories of crime strongly shape the criminal justice system at the same time as political ideology shapes prevalence of certain theories of crime. Currently crime simulations are either very strongly structural, simulating towns with opportunities for crime etc. or they are rational choice based.</p>
<p>I argue that the analysis of crime needs another kind of reasoning, as cost/benefit analysis does not suffice to explain most crime phenomena. I call this ‘other kind’ moral reasoning. In the talk I will discuss possibilities for what moral reasoning might be in this context and how it can be formalised and implemented in simulation.</p>"";s:12:""publish_down"";s:10:""2009-05-07"";s:10:""publish_up"";s:10:""2009-05-07"";s:7:""SUMMARY"";s:69:""Simulation & Norms in social science : by Corinna Elsenbroich (CRESS)"";s:11:""X-CREATEDBY"";i:62;s:7:""DTSTART"";i:1241695800;s:5:""DTEND"";i:1241701200;s:5:""RRULE"";a:4:{s:4:""FREQ"";s:4:""none"";s:5:""COUNT"";i:1;s:8:""INTERVAL"";s:1:""1"";s:5:""BYDAY"";s:2:""TH"";}s:8:""MULTIDAY"";s:1:""1"";s:9:""NOENDTIME"";s:1:""0"";s:7:""X-COLOR"";s:0:"""";}",,"22","1","0"

<p class=""p1"">New networking technologies such as wireless mobile grids and peer-to-peer middleware are examples of a growing class of open distributed systems whose strength is the absence of a central controlling instance and which function through the cooperation of autonomous entities that voluntarily commit resources to a common pool. The social dilemma in such systems is that it is advantageous for rational users to access the common pool resources without making any commitment of their own. This is commonly known as “free-riding”. However, if a substantial number of users followed this selfish strategy, the system itself would fail, depriving all users of its benefits. In the talk, I'll present parts of my dissertation that demonstrate how governance decisions can induce cooperation in such systems and how normative frameworks in combination with multi-agent system simulations can be successfully employed to analyse their effects, even at an early development stage.</p>

<p class=""p1"">The study of symbolic communication is a key research area in both the social and natural sciences. However, little has been done in order to bridge these scientific domains, so an unfortunate gulf between them still persists. Even less has been done in the field of computational sociology, in which most research using agent-based models has disregarded the importance of symbolic communication, albeit only this phenomenon can be called social in its own right. It is this lacuna that my Ph.D. thesis addressed. In the thesis, I have claimed that the type of emergent properties that are inherent to social phenomena are likely to result from the unique fact that the participating entities are symbolic agents. It is proposed that symbolic communication is a threshold phenomenon that emerges in the intersection among human cognition, social interactions and human biology. I developed a theoretical framework with which to clarify this connection, and, in order to test <em>in silico</em> some hypotheses derived from this theoretical framework, I carried out some experiments and analysis that relied upon two different agent-based models. The first agent-based model was developed to study the properties of an emergent communication system, in which groups of `speechless' agents create local lexicons and compete with each other to spread them throughout the whole population. The second agent-based model was built to study the pre-linguistic stage of cooperation among individuals required for the emergence of symbolic communication. In this talk, I will present the main results of this Ph.D. research. At the end of the session, I hope to show that by linking computational sociology to appropriate theories of language evolution, communication, evolutionary biology and cognitive research, the thesis provides conceptually-grounded mechanisms to explain the emergence and evolution of symbolic communication.</p>

<p class=""p1"">The concept of mechanism has been traditionally used in computational sociology in an informal manner. The revival of the mechanist perspective in philosophy of science, however, has led to an increased interest in clarifying its definition and functioning. Yet, despite its importance, the researchers interested in this epistemological issue have actually relied on particular definitions of mechanisms coming from theoretical sociology, instead of trying to come up with one on their own. A complication arises at this point, as several definitions of mechanism have been proposed in philosophy of science, some of them not really compatible with the core ideas of simulation as a method. The presentation will address these difficulties and the challenges a concept of mechanisms has to meet in order to be useful for computational sociology.</p>

Group interactions are modeled as iterated games in which individuals learn optimal strategies under individual and group based reward mechanisms. The space of possible games is examined and it is found that, when individual and group interests are not aligned, group evaluation and reward systems lead to higher group performance and, counter-intuitively, higher individual performance. Such groups include individuals who, quite differently to free-riders, sacrifice their own performance for the good of the group. We discuss the implications of these results for the design of incentive systems.</p>

This presentation focuses on recent efforts that study past phenomena and the challenges and methods used to address these problems despite limitations to recovering data from the past. The presentation will discuss a transportation model that looks at pedestrian movement in an ancient urban centre and another model that is used to study the effects of salinisation on agricultural and settlement systems. These cases are analysed with regard to the modelling approaches used and data collection methods employed that attempt to improve results. The results from the models show how significant and new insights are obtained on the problems addressed, while the methods employed to improve data collection and model linkages demonstrate how research projects on past societies could be structured.</p>"";s:12:""publish_down"";s:10:""2012-02-17"";s:10:""publish_up"";s:10:""2012-02-17"";s:7:""SUMMARY"";s:123:""Mark Altaweel: Facing the Challenges of Integrating Modelling Methodologies and Past Social and Social-Ecological Phenomena"";s:11:""X-CREATEDBY"";i:62;s:7:""DTSTART"";i:1329481800;s:5:""DTEND"";i:1329487200;s:5:""RRULE"";a:4:{s:4:""FREQ"";s:4:""none"";s:5:""COUNT"";i:1;s:8:""INTERVAL"";s:1:""1"";s:5:""BYDAY"";s:4:""+3FR"";}s:8:""MULTIDAY"";s:1:""1"";s:9:""NOENDTIME"";s:1:""0"";s:7:""X-COLOR"";s:0:"""";}",,"34","1","0"

It allows humans to interact with a running simulation either for participating in a multi-agent simulation scenario by controlling (or ‘playing’) one of the agents (participatory simulation) or for exploring a simulation scenario by means of intervention (exploratory simulation).</p>
<p class=""p1"">While exploratory simulation can be used for the interactive validation of a simulation model and for teaching (allowing students to experience the dynamics of a simulation model by directly interacting with it), participatory simulation allows to attack simulation problems where one (or more) of the involved human roles cannot be sufficiently faithfully modeled and therefore have to be played by human actors. I expect that both forms of simulation allow interesting applications in the social sciences.</p>

<p class=""p1"">For some time, environmental policymakers have been required to carefully consider the economic, environmental and social impact of potential policies over various spatial and temporal scales. The use of models to help address these questions is now well established. This project explores the opinions and perceptions of practitioners on the role, value, and weaknesses associated with the use of models in environmental policy. Nineteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with individuals working on environmental policy in various roles and institutions. This talk will present the findings from these interviews and reflect on the implications for both modellers and policymakers.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Agent-based modelling can be seen as a method of building middle range theories, located between abstract social theory and empirical social science. Taking both as an input, it can be used as a laboratory to investigate social theories by implementing the proposed mechanisms and comparing results to actual data. We present an implementation of Situational Action Theory (SAT), a theory put forward as a (causal) theory of the commission of crime by P-O. Wikström. SAT aims to explain the effect of the interaction between agent characteristics and environmental parameters on agent choices. It has been used to inform the collection of a longitudinal dataset of young people’s behaviour, the Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study. Through formalisation we investigate the theory's assumptions and by calibrating the resulting model against data, we investigate whether SAT is indeed a sufficient mechanism for explanation of crime.</p>

In particular, it is based on empirical research undertaken between October and December 2010 and June and July 2012, exploring how ‘scientists’ construct quality in science. Twenty interviews and four follow-­‐up focus groups were conducted and discourse analysed premised on Discursive Psychology. Quality in science was treated as ‘topic’ and the emphasis was on the ways in which scientists talk about quality in science, the resources they draw on to do so and in what context, and the ways in which they position themselves in the flow of talk. The approach employed enabled moving beyond a lexical-­‐level understanding of quality in science.</span></p>

One of the main regularities identified in the focus groups was that in talking about acceptable standards and practices in science, participants oriented to science as fragmented into different fields. I consider how these negotiations relate to immediate (focus group and interview) context and content of discussion as well as to the normativities of expressing views. </span></p>
